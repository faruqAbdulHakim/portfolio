        As Frontend Web Developer, I&apos;m familiar with various popular
        frontend technologies, such as HTML5, CSS3, Modern JavaScript, React.js,
        Tailwind CSS, etc. I also do some small tasks from my freelancer job,
        like converting the provided design into a responsive site or doing HTML
        email for company marketing purposes.

        I love to explore new things. Since I have Frontend Web development
        experience, I learned a few technologies for the Backend development
        side using Express.js as the main framework. Currently, I am learning
        Android Development using Kotlin, XML layouts, Jetpack Compose, and so
        on.
